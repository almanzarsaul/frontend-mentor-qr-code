## My process

I learned a lot from [Kevin Powell's fantastic videos](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell), especially [his recent video on Frontend Mentor](https://youtu.be/B2WL6KkqhLQ). My process was to a mobile-first design, which for this design was especially useful since there was no difference with the desktop layout. Using [Josh W. Comeau's CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/), I made a clean slate for my project which enabled me to more easily stylize the web page through CSS. After finishing the design for a mobile display, I set the max-width of the card to the approriate size and the desktop view was complete.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- How to easily center an element in CSS. ðŸ˜‚
- Using ```display: grid``` and ```gap: ...``` to space items instead of just giving margin to each individual item in a situation like this.

### Continued development
In the future I would like to hone in on proper semantic HTML with a focus on accessibility and BEM CSS conventions. 
### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
